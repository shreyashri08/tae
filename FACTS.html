    <h1> <u>TOP 8 CONSPIRACY THEORIES:-</u></h1>
    <h3> <ol>
        <li><h2> Area 51 and the Aliens:</h2><br> Area 51 has spawned more conspiracy theories than perhaps any other military facility in the world. So what is actually known about this secretive place? Area 51 is a US Air Force military installation located at Groom Lake in southern Nevada.<br>It is not accessible to the public and under 24-hour surveillance.<br> Many people have reported seeing unidentified flying objects in or near Area 51. And the popular image of the place is a secret site for extraterrestrial research. How did that come about?

            In 1989, a man named Robert Lazar claims he worked on extraterrestrial technology inside Area 51. Lazar told Las Vegas television reporter George Knapp that he saw autopsy photographs of aliens inside the facility, and that the US government used the facility to examine recovered alien spacecraft. Although Lazar himself was discredited, his claims spun numerous government conspiracy theories, most of which involve extraterrestrial life.

        <li><h2> The Moon Landings were Faked : </h2><br>Moon landing conspiracy theories claim that some or all elements of the Apollo program and the associated Moon landings were hoaxes staged by NASA, possibly with the aid of other organizations. The most notable claim is that the six crewed landings (1969–1972) were faked and that twelve Apollo astronauts did not actually walk on the Moon. Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened, by manufacturing, tampering with, or destroying evidence including photos, telemetry tapes, radio and TV transmissions, and Moon rock samples.</li>

      <li><h2> Death of Shree Lal Bahadur Shastri: </h2><br> On January 11, 56 years ago in 1966, the then Prime Minister of India, Lal Bahadur Shastri, died under mysterious circumstances in Tashkent, Soviet Union. This death was not an ordinary death. It was a death whose mystery remains unsolved even today.<br>For an executive Prime Minister of a country to die under mysterious circumstances in another country is extraordinary. But at that time, media wasn’t as strong as it is today. There were neither 24-hour news channels nor social media. So, the matter and the news were largely suppressed. And we never got to know the exact cause of Shastri's death. However, we feel that it is important to turn the pages of history associated with his death today.</li>

      <li><h2> Yeti :</h2> <br>The Yeti (/ˈjɛti/)[1] is an ape-like creature purported to inhabit the Himalayan mountain range in Asia. In western popular culture, the creature is commonly referred to as the Abominable Snowman. Many dubious articles have been offered in an attempt to prove the existence of the Yeti, including anecdotal visual sightings, disputed video recordings, photographs, and plaster casts of large footprints. Some of these are speculated or known to be hoaxes.

        Folklorists trace the origin of the Yeti to a combination of factors including Sherpa folklore and misidentified fauna such as bear or yak.[2] The Yeti is commonly compared to Bigfoot of North America, as the two subjects often have similar physical descriptions.</li>

        <li> <h2>Princess Diana's Murder :</h2> <br>Various conspiracy theories have arisen surrounding the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.[1] Official investigations in both Britain and France found that Diana died in a manner consistent with media reports following the fatal car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997. In 1999, a French investigation concluded that Diana died as the result of a crash.[2] The French investigator, Judge Hervé Stephan, concluded that the paparazzi were some distance from the Mercedes S280 when it crashed and were not responsible.[3] After hearing evidence at the British inquest, a jury in 2008 returned a verdict of "unlawful killing" by driver Henri Paul and the paparazzi pursuing the car.[4] The jury's verdict also stated: "In addition, the death of the deceased was caused or contributed to by the fact that the deceased were not wearing a seat belt and by the fact that the Mercedes struck the pillar in the Alma Tunnel rather than colliding with something else.</li>

       <li> <h2>Satanism:</h2> <br>Satanism, any of various religious or countercultural practices and movements centred on the figure of Satan, the Devil, regarded in Christianity and Judaism as the embodiment of absolute evil. Historical Satanism, also called devil worship, consists of belief in and worship of the Judeo-Christian Devil and the explicit rejection of his antithesis, God, and (in Christianity) God’s Incarnation, Jesus Christ. It was traditionally based on the “black mass,” a corrupted rendition of the Christian Eucharist, and ritual magic evocations of Satan. </li>

       <li> <h2>9 Unknown Men:<br></h2> There is also one of the oldest secret organizations in India, “The Nine Unknown Men”, which was founded by the great Mauryan emperor Ashoka in 270 BC. 

        The Nine Unknown Men was a secret club that exerted a significant influence in making social, political, economic, and scientific progress.
        
        Ashoka ordered his nine unknown soldiers to always remain secret, and it is believed that they still exist and the secrets and secrets kept have been passed down through generations.</li>
